# Oracle and Entity Framework Solution
I have used this solution for an internal presentation at the company I work for called Dealertrack.

SE CoP (Software Engineering Community of Practice) - Unit Testing and Moq Frameworks Presentation

What you will find on this Repository:
* Basic Unit Testing
* Parameterized Unit Testing
* Basic Mocking
* Mocking DataBase Classes 
* Working Data Access for Oracle using Entity Framework 6,

No prior installation is required (No GAC assemblies, no Softwares such as Oracle Visual Studio Tools, etc).
Everything is done through NuGet Packages.
